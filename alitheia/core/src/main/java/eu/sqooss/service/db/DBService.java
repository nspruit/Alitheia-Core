/**
 * This is the service providing access to the Alitheia Database,
 * including project metadata, user management, metrics data...
 * 
 * The API includes methods for retrieving data access objects (DAO) by id or by properties,
 * and adding/deleting records in the database, and general-purpose querying methods
 * for lower-level database access.
 * Access and manipulation of the data is done directly through the DAOs in an object-oriented way.
 * 
 * All access to the DB service has to be done in the context of a session. You can see the session
 * as the connection to the database and the transaction for that connection.
 * The method startDBSession() initialises a session, while commitDBSession() and rollbackDBSession()
 * end the session, by committing or cancelling the changes respectively.
 * You can also query the current state of the session with the method isDBSessionActive().
 * 
 * All the methods in this interface are thread-safe, which means you can call these methods on the
 * same DBService object from different threads without needed to protect the access to the object.
 * Furthermore, each session is handled within the context of a thread. So if two different threads
 * have code that call startDBSession(), they will each start their own, and whatever they do during
 * the session will be isolated from the other. (ie. no DAO sharing, no changes visible accross threads...)
 * 
 * No exceptions are thrown by methods in this service. Notification of success or failure is achieved
 * through return values. Exception handling for the actual db access and Hibernate is all handled
 * internally, and all resources are guaranteed to be released properly if an error occurs.
 * All errors are automatically logged into Alitheia's log file. (see Logger service)
 * 
 * nb: the package eu.sqooss.service.db contains all the Alitheia predefined DAOs that are used by
 * the platform, but it is also possible to add your own DAOs in metrics installed by Alitheia.
 * See the implementation of the developer contribution metric 
 * (under metrics/contrib) for an example how to achieve that.
