# Assignment 2 - Testing and Refactoring Report

Intro

## Chosen violation
What are the violations and which classes/packages are involved in the violation? Why is it a shortcoming? (See previous report+include numbers). Why do we want to fix this?

## Testing
Intro

### Coverage before
Show coverage image and explain

### Writing tests
What did we test, why and how? Explain InMemoryDB, mocking in unit tests, integration tests, etc.

### Coverage after
Show coverage image after the tests have been written. Also explain that the tests are sufficient for the refactoring.

## Refactoring
Intro

### Suggested design
Show UML diagram and explain. Also explain why this solves the violations, has a low probability of introducing new bugs, etc. 

### Updating the tests
Explain how we updated the written tests according to the new design. Explain this separately for each of the following test classes:

* DBObject
* DBTransactionTest
* HQLQueryInterfaceTest
* HQLQueryInterfaceImplTest
* InMemoryDatabase
* QueryInterfaceTest
* ConfigurationOptionTest
* MetricTest

### Implementing the new design
How did we create the new design/updated the old classes (by incrementally getting more tests to pass)? Also indicate this for each of the following actions:

* Create DBSessionManager
* Create DBSessionManagerImpl
* Create QueryInterface, HQLQueryInterface and SQLQueryInterface
* Create HQLQueryInterfaceImpl
* Create SQLQueryInterfaceImpl 
* Update DBService
* Update DBServiceImpl
* Create DBSessionValidation to get rid of duplicate logging code
* Also: Update calls to session management methods
* Also: Update calls to query functions

## Results
What are the results of the refactoring? Are the violations gone and why? Try to include hard numbers here. Why is this a good thing for future maintenance? Also explain that and why we are convinced that we haven't introduced new bugs and the system still works the same as before.

## Conclusion
Is this section necessary? Maybe merge with Results section.
